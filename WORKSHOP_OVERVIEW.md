# Rust Workshop: Building a Spotify Music Analysis App

## Executive Summary

This hands-on workshop introduces engineering teams to Rust programming through building a real-world application that integrates with Spotify's API and OpenAI's AI services. The workshop consists of two parts, one before lunch and one after lunch, during which participants will learn core Rust concepts while creating a functional music analysis tool, gaining practical experience with Rust.

## Workshop Overview

**Duration**: 4 hours (2 hours per session)  
**Format**: In-person or virtual  
**Group Size**: 8-20 participants  
**Prerequisites**: Basic programming experience (any language)  
**Deliverable**: Working application with API integrations

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
- Understand Rust's ownership and borrowing system
- Work with Rust's type system and error handling
- Use async/await for concurrent programming
- Integrate external APIs using Rust crates
- Debug common Rust compilation errors
- Build production-ready API integrations

## Workshop Structure

### Part 1: Rust Concepts & Error Handling (2 hours)
- **Focus**: Understanding Rust's core concepts through intentional compilation errors
- **Method**: Debugging and fixing errors in existing code
- **Key Concepts**: Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, error handling, traits, generics, iterators

### Part 2: API Integration & Feature Development (2 hours)
- **Focus**: Adding new functionality using Spotify and OpenAI APIs
- **Method**: Implementing new features and API integrations
- **Key Skills**: Async programming, REST API integration, JSON handling, authentication

## Business Value

### For Engineering Teams
- **Modern Systems Programming**: Learn Rust's memory safety without garbage collection
- **Performance**: Understand zero-cost abstractions and compile-time guarantees
- **Reliability**: Experience error handling that prevents runtime crashes
- **Concurrency**: Safe concurrent programming with async/await

### For Organizations
- **Technology Modernization**: Introduce Rust to existing tech stacks
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce debugging time with compile-time error detection
- **System Reliability**: Build more robust applications with fewer runtime errors
- **Future-Proofing**: Prepare teams for Rust adoption in production systems

## Technical Highlights

- **Real-World APIs**: Integration with Spotify Web API and OpenAI
- **Production Patterns**: Error handling, authentication, rate limiting
- **Modern Rust**: Async/await, serde serialization, reqwest HTTP client
- **Best Practices**: Ownership patterns, trait implementations, generic types
