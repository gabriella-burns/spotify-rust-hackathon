# Workshop Part 1: Rust Concepts & Error Handling

## Session Overview

**Duration**: 2 hours (Morning Session)  
**Focus**: Understanding Rust's core concepts through intentional compilation errors  
**Learning Method**: Debugging and fixing errors in existing code

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Part 1, participants will be able to:
- Understand Rust's ownership and borrowing system
- Read and interpret Rust compiler error messages
- Fix common compilation errors
- Work with Rust's type system and error handling

## Session Structure

### **Setup and Introduction** (30 minutes)
- Environment setup
- Project structure overview
- Introduction to Rust's safety guarantees

### **Core Concepts Deep Dive** (60 minutes)
- Ownership and borrowing
- Error handling with Result types
- Structs and traits
- Generics and type parameters
- Iterators and functional programming

### **Debugging and Common Errors** (30 minutes)
- Working through intentional compilation errors
- Understanding compiler error messages
- Best practices for avoiding common pitfalls

## Key Rust Concepts Covered

- **Ownership & Borrowing**: Understanding who owns data and when it's transferred
- **Error Handling**: Using `Result<T, E>` and custom error types
- **Structs and Traits**: Organizing data and defining shared behavior
- **Generics**: Writing code that works with multiple types
- **Iterators**: Processing data with functional programming patterns

## Teaching Approach

- **Interactive Learning**: Live coding demonstrations and pair programming
- **Progressive Complexity**: Building from simple to complex concepts
- **Practical Application**: Real API integrations and immediate feedback

## Key Teaching Moments

The session includes **intentional compilation errors** to teach:
- Ownership issues and dangling references
- Lifetime problems and borrowing violations
- Trait implementation mistakes
- Iterator misuse

## Hands-on Exercises

- **Exercise 1**: Ownership debugging
- **Exercise 2**: Lifetime annotations
- **Exercise 3**: Borrowing violations
- **Exercise 4**: Trait implementation
- **Exercise 5**: Iterator usage

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Part 1, participants will have:
- A solid understanding of Rust's ownership and borrowing system
- Confidence in reading and fixing compilation errors
- Experience with Rust's type system and error handling
- Foundation for building larger Rust applications

## Preparation for Part 2

Part 1 provides the foundation needed for Part 2, where participants will:
- Add new functionality using Spotify and OpenAI APIs
- Implement async programming patterns
- Build new features with confidence in Rust's safety guarantees
