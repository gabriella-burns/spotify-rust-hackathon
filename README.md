# Rust Workshop: Building a Spotify Music Analysis App

## Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop introduces participants to Rust programming through building a real-world application that integrates with Spotify's API and OpenAI's AI services.

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into two parts:

### **Part 1: Rust Concepts & Error Handling** (Morning Session)
- **Duration**: 2 hours (including breaks)
- **Focus**: Understanding Rust's core concepts through intentional compilation errors
- **Learning Method**: Debugging and fixing errors in existing code

### **Part 2: API Integration & Feature Development** (Afternoon Session)
- **Duration**: 2 hours (including breaks)
- **Focus**: Adding new functionality using Spotify and OpenAI APIs
- **Learning Method**: Implementing new features and API integrations

## Duration
**4 hours total** (2 hours per part, including breaks and Q&A)

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming experience (any language)
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- No prior Rust experience required

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
- Understand Rust's ownership and borrowing system
- Work with Rust's type system and error handling
- Use async/await for concurrent programming
- Integrate external APIs using Rust crates
- Debug common Rust compilation errors

## Core Rust Concepts Covered

- **Ownership & Borrowing**: Understanding who owns data and when it's transferred
- **Error Handling**: Using `Result<T, E>` and custom error types
- **Structs and Traits**: Organizing data and defining shared behavior
- **Generics**: Writing code that works with multiple types
- **Iterators**: Processing data with functional programming patterns
- **Async Programming**: Writing non-blocking code with async/await

## Teaching Approach

- **Interactive Learning**: Live coding demonstrations and pair programming
- **Progressive Complexity**: Building from simple to complex concepts
- **Practical Application**: Real API integrations and immediate feedback

## Key Teaching Moments

The workshop includes **intentional compilation errors** to teach:
- Ownership issues and dangling references
- Lifetime problems and borrowing violations
- Trait implementation mistakes
- Iterator misuse

## Expected Outcomes

Participants will leave with:
- A working Spotify music analysis application
- Deep understanding of Rust's core concepts
- Confidence in reading and writing Rust code
- Ability to debug common compilation errors
- Experience with real-world API integration
